### HOW MY PROJECT WORKS

### REGISTERATION FROM :STEP 1
To create an account --> Fill the registration form


### DATABASE TABLE IN MYSQL(named as register)
The database used is MySQL, so you'll need a MySQL database to run create the users table.
Run the file in MySQL database to create users table


### INSERT FILE : step 1.1
The PHP script to connect to the database is in `config/config.php` directory.
Replace credentials to in `config.php` to match your server credentials.

### REGISTERATION FORM AND INSERT : step 1.2
The `register.php` creates a web form that allows users to register themselves.
The script generates error if form input is empty and username is has been taking already by another user.

Submit the form --> For successful registration in my database

## LOGIN SYSTEM : step 2
To enter the profile --> Login with your credentials

### LOGIN FORM AND INSERT
`login.php` is the login script.
When a user submit a form with the input of username and password, these inputs will be verified against the credentials data stored in the database, if there is a match then the user will be authorized and granted access to site or page.

### WELCOME PAGE : STEP 3
User is redirected to `welcome.php` if login is successful.

step 3 is the last page in the webpage "guvi project" created by i UMA GANESH MANNEPALLI.
there is also a feedback form to give any suggestions.

Thanks you...........!
